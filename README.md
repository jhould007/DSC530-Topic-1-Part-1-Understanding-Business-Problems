# Assignment Instructions
The most important part of creating a machine learning model is having sound business knowledge of the problem you're trying to solve.

In 500-750 words, complete the following:
1. Formulate a prediction and an inferential question that you want to answer by applying predictive modeling. Ex: Prediction Question: How accurately and how far into the future can I predict the price of a house given the values of all the variables. Inferential Question: How accurately can I estimate the effect of each variable on the house price?
2. Search and locate a dataset that is relevant to the question(s) you created in the previous step. You may search repositories such as Data.gov, UCI Machine Learning, Kaggle, or Scikit-Learn. Find a dataset with no less than 10 variables and 10,000 observations, mostly quantitative.
3. Discuss the origin of the data and assess whether it was obtained in an ethical manner.
4. Explain your dataset's variables. List your dependent and independent variables, and identify which scale is used to measure each variable (interval, ordinal, or nominal). Hint: interval is the most appropriate scale for regression analysis.

APA style is not required, but solid academic writing is expected. This assignment uses a rubric. Please review the rubric prior to beginning the assignment to become familiar with the expectations for successful completion. You are not required to submit this assignment to LopesWrite.
